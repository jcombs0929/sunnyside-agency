## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more about how to structure media queries for mobile first design. I also learned how to apply CSS Grid responsively.

### Continued development

Overall, I would like to add more interactivity/animations throughout all my designs as I code. This site, while functional, is very plain and does not envoke interest. With more time, I would change this.
